## Introduction

Hello - I'm Cody. I'm a 26 year old that lives in Orlando Florida and works remote for a government contractor. I live with my Fiance Laura and pug son named CJ. We are both from up north (PA and DC). 

I decided that it was finally time for me to create my blog site I have been wanting to make and now I am doing it. Im creating a site mainly to share my war stories about what I deal with at work during my day to day. As mentioned above, I work for a defense government contractor and I am a Kubernetes Platform Engineer. We have a unqiue platform and there are alot of fun stories I can tell you about. 

I will try to post everyday but we will see. For now, sit back and wait for the content. More to come.

Cody
